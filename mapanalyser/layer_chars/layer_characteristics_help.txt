This algorithm calculates the topological and semantic characteristics of a layer and
for linear layers:
--the number of bends in the line and the average bend characteristics: height, length, area and baseline length
for polygon layers:
--the total area, total perimeter, average polygon area in the layer and average polygon perimeter in the layer
Topological and semantic characteristics are features count, ratios of unique values, common length (and the common number of intersections, but you must use a different module to calculate this characteristic, because it takes a long time to calculate it).
