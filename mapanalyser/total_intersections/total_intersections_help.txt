This is an algorithm that calculates the total number of intersections of linear and polygon layers.
The steps of the algorithm:
0. Converting polygon layers to linear layers
1. Merge layers
2. Find end points of lines
3. Find intersections (this may take a long time, please keep calm)
4. Get true intersections
5. Build output layer

Input: Vector layers
Output: Output layer with the points of intersection, processing log
