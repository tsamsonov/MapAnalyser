The compression ratio shows the ratio of the size of the compressed image of map to the original one.
If the ratio is close to 1, the map is not compressed well, so the map can be considered complex.

Input:
--Canvas name: used in the name of the output image and the results table
--Minimum extent to render: defines the part of the map that needs to be processed (default the map canvas extent used)
--Output image width: width of the rendered map image
--Output image height: height of the rendered map image

Output:
--Output file: the results table in .CSV format
--Log: processing log
